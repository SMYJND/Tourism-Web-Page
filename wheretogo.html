          <p>
            Horton Plains National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site,
            situated at an altitude 2,100–2,300 metres and located in Central
            Sri Lanka. It is a government protected area which is surrounded by
            massive cloudy forests and never-ending grasslands. Horton Plains
            National Park is a popular destination to visit the famed ‘World’s
            End Cliff’, a long, steep plunge of 880m where the plateau comes to
            a dramatic stop.

          <p>
            Sri Dalada Maligawa is the Sinhalese name for this holy shrine.
            Famously called Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, it is touted to be
            the most sacred Buddhist temple in the whole world. It houses the
            tooth of Buddha nestled in a golden chamber and is within the
            premises of the royal palace complex (formerly a princely state).
            Kandy is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it is said that whichever
            state holds the tooth relic, maintains an essential place in the
            governance of the country.

            waterfalls and tea plantations to gardens and lakes, Nuwara Eliya is

            buildings dotting the area, a golf course and the cold climate— and
            you'll feel like you have entered a world unlike Sri Lanka's iconic
            landscape; no wonder it is also called Little England!

          <p>
            Lovely Arugam Bay, a moon-shaped curl of soft sand, is home to a
            famed point break that many regard as the best surf spot in the
            country. It's a tiny place, with a population of a few hundred, and
            everything is dotted along a single road which parallels the coast.
            So in other words, the epitome of the laid-back beach scene that
            first drew surfers and sun-seekers to Sri Lanka. If you’re not a
            surfer, there are plenty of other draws: beachfront guesthouses,
            oceanside restaurants and a mellow, swing-another-day-in-a-hammock
            kind of vibe that’s totally removed from the brash west-coast beach
            resorts. Arugam Bay also makes a great base for several adventures
            in the surrounding hinterland. During the low season (November to
            April) things get extremely quiet and many places close altogether,
            but it can also be a serene time to visit, with few tourists and
            verdant landscapes.

            is a significant Hindu Temple that has gone through many prosperous
            years, as well as many turbulent ones during European colonisation.
            Located inside the historic Fort Frederick, the temple gives that

            European setting.

            Scenic attraction, wildlife and walking trails seek the attention of
            large chunk of visitors. Its location of approximately 188
            kilometers away from the capital city Colombo makes it easily

            Elephants, Bears, Deer, Crocodiles, Reptiles and also ample verities
            of birds. The unique feature of this park is that the existence of
            "Willus"—a natural, sand-rimmed water lake and basins or depressions
            filling in with rainwater make it distinct. After rainy seasons,
            they are dried up. Declared as a National Park in 1938, its lake
